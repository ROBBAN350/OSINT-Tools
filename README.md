# OSINT-Tools
This is a collection of different useful OSINT tools, nothing more...

This collection is a bit unorganized and empty because this repository is still new. And I don't really focus on it that much. It's just a thing I created for people who need some OSINT tools that are used for different things.

## The List
[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) - Search engine that can be used to find different vulnerable machines around the world

[Datasploit](https://github.com/datasploit/datasploit/) - OSINT Automation tool that can gather info from domains, emails, usernames, phones
